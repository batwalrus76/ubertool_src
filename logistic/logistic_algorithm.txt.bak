<li>Logistic model includes two ecological processes: reproduction and competition </li> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>Both processes depend on population numbers (or density) </li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>The rate of both processes corresponds to the mass-action law with coefficients: ro for reproduction and ro/K for competition</li>
