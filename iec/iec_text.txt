<p>This is based on the formula logLC<sub>k</sub> = logLC<sub>50</sub>+(z/b)</p>
<ul class="nobullet">
  <li>Where: z is the standard normal deviate and b equals slope</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Works for dose-response models based on a probit assumption (i.e. log normal distribution of individual sensitivity)</p>
